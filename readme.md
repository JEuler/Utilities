## Utilities 
This is repo for the simple and useful scripts for the Unity (Unity3D). All the scripts will include the comments about their work.
Not everything I done myself, but I am trying to be useful. :-) 

## Settings Manager
Simple and easy to use code for working with the IsolatedStorage for storing something between app launches in Windows Phone

## Converters
Everybody already writes that kind of stuff for them, but I want it to be here. PathToImageSource may be useful, btw.
